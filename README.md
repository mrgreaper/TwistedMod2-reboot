TwistedMod2-reboot
==================

reboot of my twistedmod 2 (which was never released) as i need to relearn a lot !
Note this mod is Dark Humour, it is not for kids.
Also no actual animal cruelty was performed (and in non computer life, ie the real world, i would NEVER EVER hurt an animal, even a bunny! renember folks videogames != reality

I am using the GNU GPL V2.0 License
but to sum up my interpretation of it:
1)you can copy any of my code for your own uses provided your mod is opensource with out needing to ask me.
2)you must credit me if you have used my code (tbh thats just polite lol, and hell just a thanks in mods thread is ok)(doubt anyone would use my code though...im still rather new)
3)you cant hold me liable if my code eats your cat, threatens your dog and release bunnys into your kitchen
